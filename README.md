# What you are learning
* HTML
* CSS

(These are the things needed to present and format content.)

# What software you need
You won't need to install ruby or anything to edit these but a text editor like Coda http://panic.com/coda/ would be ideal. There are free ones too - happy to recommend some but Coda has a free trial. You can technically edit your html/css with any text editor - so even TextEdit on your Mac will be suitable for your first try.

# What you will need to edit
You will need to edit the following files.

* Index.html 
This is basically the page with all the content and html markup. Preview this by navigating to the index.html in your browser and hit refresh every time you make a change. Or you can use Coda's preview tool.

* main.css
This is the css file, if you scroll down inside the file you will see an area i made you where you can add/edit css styles. Currently no colour or styling has been applied. There's plenty of resources around to help but always feel free to ask - even on twitter you'll get the answer.

* Comments:
Html 
```html comments start with <!-- and end with -->```
For example:
```<!-- Edit the element below -->```
CSS
```css comments start with /* and end with */```
For example: ```/* hello kyra */```

Comments won't affect the design or behavior, they're there for your refecence but some of them you may want to remove as they can be visible if somebody looks at the source code. Most of them can stay apart form the ones I specifically put there for you :)

* Form:
